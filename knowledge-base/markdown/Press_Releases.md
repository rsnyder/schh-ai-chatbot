### Sun City Hilton Head Community Association Wins Publishing Awards

\- August 5, 2021

The Sun City Hilton Head Community Association was recognized in July for its work in print and digital communication by two national publishing competitions.

The Sun City Hurricane Preparedness Guide was honored with an Award of Excellence in the 33rd annual APEX Awards competition. The APEX Awards are based on excellence in graphic design, editorial content, and the ability to achieve overall communications excellence. This is the first time the Community Association has participated in this program.

“We are always looking for new ways to spotlight the work we do for Sun City Hilton Head,” said the Association’s Director of Communication Jennifer Mathis. “The Communication staff devotes a lot of time and creative energy to our publications, so we are proud to showcase the materials we produce for the community on a national stage.”

The Association also received four awards in the 2021 National Mature Media Awards program, which is organized by the Mature Market Resource Center (MMRC).

The SunFit video channel and the Video Library on [SunCityHiltonHead.org](https://suncityhiltonhead.org/), both produced in partnership with the Bluffton-based videography company Crescent Moon Pictures, each captured a gold Mature Media Award. This year marks the first time the Association has participated in the video categories of this competition, having launched Sun City’s video program in 2020.

The other Mature Media Awards included a gold award for the monthly City Life eNewsletter and a merit award for the June issue of SunSations.

The National Mature Media Awards annually recognize the best in marketing, communications, educational materials and programs for older adults. The Association has successfully participated in this program since 2018, earning multiple awards in each year that it has submitted entries.

The recognition from the APEX Awards and Mature Media Awards comes just weeks after the Community Association was honored with EXCEL Awards from Association Media & Publishing earlier this summer.

“Our ability to capture this amount of consistent national recognition just proves that the Community Association is dedicated to producing only the very best content for the residents of Sun City Hilton Head,” Mathis said.

### Sun City Hilton Head Thanks Frontline Workers

\-April 24, 2020

Sun City Hilton Head residents used their creative talents to proudly show their support for the essential workers who remain at the forefront of the fight against COVID-19.

### Sun City Hilton Head Becomes A Solar-Panel Friendly Community

\-February 25, 2020

The Sun City Hilton Head Board of Directors is pleased to announce a change to the Community Association’s governing policies that will introduce relaxed regulations for the placement of solar panels on homes inside the community.

The Board’s decision allows residents to install solar panels on the side and rear roofs even if they are visible from homes with golf course or lagoon views. Residents who wish to install solar panels must still follow the current application process for exterior home modifications.

The change revises Sun City Hilton Head’s Design Guidelines, a set of governing documents that outlines a set of standards for exterior house appearance and curb appeal.

The Board unanimously approved the revision to express support for residents’ desires to make personal choices to live environmentally friendly lifestyles. The decision came after a community-wide survey that showed overwhelming support for more lenient rules about the placement of solar panels.

“The Design Guideline changes were made in response to the community’s wishes,” said General Manager Brad Phillips. “The choices for solar energy are evolving, and it’s important to the Board and the Association that our design standards also evolve in ways that benefit the resident, the planet and the community’s property values as a whole.”

Sun City residents may download a copy of the Design Guidelines from the Community Library of SunCityHiltonHead.org.
