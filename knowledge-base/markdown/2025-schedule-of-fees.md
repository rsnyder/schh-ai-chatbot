#  COMMUNITY RULES 2025

## 1. INTRODUCTION

The Community Rules of SUN CITY HILTON HEAD COMMUNITY ASSOCIATION, INC., a South Carolina non-profit corporation (the “Association”), are established by the Board of Directors of the Association (the “Board”) under the authority described in the Governing Documents for Sun City Hilton Head. Per section 1.22 of the Declaration of Covenants, Conditions, & Restrictions (“CC&Rs”), the Governing Documents are defined as the Declaration and any Supplemental Declaration, the Bylaws, rules and regulations, the Design Guidelines, the Use Restrictions, or any document authorized pursuant to any of them, as amended from time to time. These Community Rules may be expanded, amended or repealed by the Board of Directors of the Association, in its sole discretion.

The Association shall apply and enforce these Community Rules with members and residents equally. All members and residents have the right to enjoy and use the Association facilities. Members are responsible for the compliance with these rules by all tenants, guests, vendors and invitees.

Sun City Hilton Head is special in that it is intended to provide housing primarily for persons 55 years of age or older. The community is operated as an age restricted community in compliance with all applicable State and Federal laws. Every household shall be occupied by at least one resident who is age qualified “Qualifying Occupant” (55 or older, except certain sales by the Developer to persons between 50 and 55). In the event any Qualifying Occupant ceases to reside in the Dwelling Unit, such person’s co-occupants may continue to occupy such Dwelling. At no time shall less than 80% of the Dwellings be occupied by single families where at least one member is not a Qualifying Occupant. Children under the age of 19 may not be residents under any circumstance, but may qualify as guests for a maximum of 90 days in any calendar year.

The use of the Association facilities is primarily for the enjoyment of the members of the Association and residents of the community. Guests are welcome in the community, but guests are accommodated only when their participation does not infringe upon the convenience or right of enjoyment of the members and/or residents. Guests are permitted into the community by invitation only, and are subject to specific restrictions, procedures and rules including payment of any applicable fees prior to use of any amenity. While every effort is made to provide comfort­able use of the Association facilities by all members, residents and guests, the Association facilities are not intended to serve the general public and, therefore, will not be identical to those available in public accommodations. While the Association will attempt to accommodate members and residents with special needs, the Association reserves the right to charge fees to those members and occupants for special accommodation requests. Organized instruction, such as group/individual classes, on all Association property shall be taught by Sun City Hilton Head Community Association staff and/or community approved contractors only. 

Definitions for terms used in this Policy: 

Common Area Property: All Association owned property including but not limited to buildings, grounds, trails, side­walks leading to facilities and recreation areas, golf courses, roads, right of ways, lagoons, and wetlands.

Guest: A guest is defined as a person who visits or stays overnight in a Sun City home and does NOT stay for more than 30 days in a consecutive 6 month period.

Member: A person entitled to membership in the Association. While each owner of a lot shall be a member of the Association, there is only one membership per lot. If a lot is owned by more than one person, all co-owners share the privileges of the membership, subject to the provisions of the Governing Documents. 

Occupant or Resident: A person who stays overnight in a Sun City home for more than 30 days in a consecutive 6-month period, as defined in the Governing Documents.

Owner: One or more persons who hold the record title to any lot, except persons holding an interest merely as security for the performance of an obligation in which case the equitable owner will be considered the Owner. 

## 2. SOURCE OF AUTHORITY

In the event of a conflict between any provision of the Community Rules and any provision of such other Governing Documents, the Governing Documents shall control. To the extent that any government ordinances are more restrictive than that found in the Governing Documents, the government ordinances shall prevail. To the extent that government ordinances are less restrictive, then the Governing Documents shall prevail. Please refer to section 19.6 of the CC&Rs. 

The Governing Documents make a clear distinction between Community Rules and Use Restrictions. The initial Use Restrictions as listed in Exhibit “C” of the CC&Rs are interpreted as restrictions or rules that affect an owner’s ability to use his privately owned property. The Board of Directors is obligated to provide notice to all owners of a proposed rule which would modify, cancel, limit, create exceptions to, or expand the Use Restrictions, and which would affect an owner’s ability to use his privately owned property.

Alternately, the Bylaws of this community provide that the Board of Directors of the Sun City Hilton Head Community Association, Inc., may make and amend rules and regulations, and establish penalties for infractions. This means that the Board may implement reasonable Rules and Regulations affecting the Community Association that do not affect the initial Use Restrictions, and which govern Association property and/or individual conduct and uses of or actions upon the Properties, without notice to private property owners.

The Governing Documents grant to the Board of Directors the authority to make and enforce appropriate policies, rules and regulations, including the ability to restrict the use of the Association facilities. Policies, rules and regulations are adopted at the sole discretion of the Board of Directors in its exercise of reasonable business judgment and fuduciary duty to the members. The Board’s duties, however, are subject to certain rights reserved to Del Webb Communities, Inc., as the developer of Sun City Hilton Head and the Declarant under the CC&Rs. Certain rights with respect to the use of Association facilities and other Common Area have been retained by or granted to the Declarant in the Governing Documents, and nothing in these Community Rules may diminish, modify or supersede these rights.

The General Manager of the Association is empowered by the Governing Documents and the Board to implement the rules and requirements of the Governing Documents, Board policy and these Community Rules. The Board extends wide latitude to the General Manager to create and implement any and all operating/administrative procedures necessary to implement actions of the Board, or intended requirements of the Governing Documents. This delegation of authority includes, but is not limited to, the levying of Board-approved fines and other sanctions for violations of the Governing Documents.

The CC&Rs set forth the right of the Association to charge reasonable admission and other fees for the use of any Association facility. The CC&Rs also authorize the Board to permit use of portions of the Common Area by third parties for purposes felt to benefit the Community. 

The CC&Rs also authorize the Association to impose sanctions (penalties) for violation of the Governing Documents, CC&Rs, the Bylaws, Community Rules and Board policies. If required by the CC&Rs and/or Bylaws, notice and hearing of intended sanctions may be initiated. 

Sanctions may include, but without limitation:
- Imposition of reasonable monetary fines
- Suspension of an Owner’s voting rights
- Suspension of a person’s right to use any of the Association facilities, including temporary or permanent expul­sion from a Chartered Club
- Suspension of services to an Owner or to an Owner’s lot
- Levying benefited assessments against an Owner’s lot to cover expenses incurred in accordance with Section 10.7(b) of the CC&Rs
- Board established monetary fines as shown in the annual Schedule of Fees

The Association shall not be obligated to take any such action. The determination not to take action shall not be construed as a waiver of any right of the Association to enforce such provision under other circumstances.

## 3. ACTIVITY CARDS

### 3.1. Activity Cards

Non-transferable activity cards are issued free of charge on a two-per-lot basis upon completion of a blanket Acknowledgment of Risk and Waiver of Liability form. Ownership of each lot shall entitle the Owner thereof to receive a maximum of two (2) activity cards as long as the Dwelling Unit of the Owner, if occupied, is occupied by at least one individual 55 years of age or older “Qualifying Occupant”(written verification of eligibility and occupancy will be requested). New builds may be sold to a person at age 50 at the discretion of the developer. If there are more than two (2) occupants of a qualified Dwelling Unit, the Owner shall designate in writing, the two individuals to whom activity card(s) are to be issued.

No individual will be issued more than one activity card. Lost, stolen, or damaged cards may be replaced for a fee. Activity card(s) are issued at the Association’s administrative ofce provided the lot continues to be occupied by a Qualifying Occupant and all applicable assessments and other charges pertaining to the lot have been paid to the Association. Providing use of one’s activity card to another person (resident or guest) to allow access to a Sun City amenity is prohibited.

#### 3.1.1. Additional Cards

If there are more than two (2) occupants of a Dwelling Unit in which there is a Qualifying Occupant, a maximum of two (2) cards per bedroom for Qualifying Occupants may be purchased. Per the CC&Rs, the occupancy of a Dwelling Unit is defined as two persons per bedroom. Additional activity cards may be purchased for such charge as established by the Board and shall be renewed in the manner set forth by the Board of Directors. Activity cards purchased July 1 or later shall be 50% of the annual fee. Residents will be billed an activity card renewal fee annually on the first of the year regardless of when the card was initially purchased. There is no refund on additional activity cards purchased. This fee shall be paid annually on a calendar year basis and shall not be pro-rated. Additional occupants are not required to purchase activity cards, but are not entitled to utilize Association facilities or Common Areas unless a card is purchased. Additional occupants shall not be extended guest privileges.

#### 3.1.2. Activity Card Checks

Activity card checks may be made by Association staff and Security to monitor compliance with card policy and to determine validity of activity cards and guest ID cards.

#### 3.1.3. Activity Registration

Activity cardholders may register for various activities and classes at the appropriate facility upon presentation of a valid activity card. However, Chartered Club activities and classes may have further requirements, restrictions and guest policies.

#### 3.1.4. Non-Refundable

There are no refunds for any activity cards. 

#### 3.1.5. Non-Transferable

Activity cards are non-transferable. They are not to be lent or given to a resident or a guest for entry into amenities. Providing use of one’s activity card to an unauthorized person to gain access to a Sun City amenity will result in a fne. Activity cards shall be required for entry into facilities utilizing the card access system.

### 3.2. Renters’ Activity Cards 

The Owner (lessor) shall have registered with Resident Services in order to rent their home. An Owner who leases such Owner’s Lot shall be deemed to have assigned such rights to the lessee of such Lot, unless (i) the Board adopts rules and regulations permitting Owner’s such rights and (ii) such Owner provides the Board with written notice of such reservation which is consistent with the rules and regulations of the Board. Written notice of the transfer of occupancy shall be given to the Association within 15 days, and the owner shall surrender to the Association his/her 

previously issued activity card(s). The right of the lessee(s) to receive the activity card(s) allocable to the homeowner (lessor) must be in compliance with the age restrictions set forth in Section 2.3 of the CC&R’s. The lessee(s) is subject to the same qualifications, limitations and conditions, including the payment of any fee that may be established by the Board, as specified in issuance of residents’ activity cards. This fee shall be paid annually per renter through the rental registration process (see Community Related Offenses in the Schedule of Fees and Renter Obligations in the Community Rules). No refunds will be issued upon termination of the lease, or if renters move from the community. Renter activity cards will not be issued unless the Owner (lessor) surrenders his/her activity cards to the Association.

#### 3.2.1. Account Status

The Owner (lessor) must be current and in good standing with the Association. If an Owner’s privileges are suspended while a lessee is in the home, the lessee’s activity card(s), vehicle decal and RFID tag will be suspended until the homeowner brings his/her account into good standing with the Association. An Owner is responsible for the payment of all charges, fees and fines incurred by the Owner’s lessee should such amounts not be paid by the lessee. These charges will be added to the Owner’s account and are collectable in the same manner as any assessment authorized under the CC&Rs.

#### 3.2.2. Leasing until Close of Escrow (COE)

Customers who have signed binding contracts to purchase a home in Sun City Hilton Head, who are leasing, and who meet the qualifications of a Qualifying Occupant upon close of escrow, may purchase activity cards allowing use of Association facilities until close of escrow. A fee shall be assessed for the transfer of the right to use the facilities from the homeowner to the lessee. No refunds will be issued. Upon close of escrow, activity cards shall be surrendered and activity cards will be issued in accordance with the CC&Rs. If a cancellation or termination of a homebuyer’s contract occurs, all renters’ activity cards will be immediately revoked. 

#### 3.2.3. Privileges Associated with Membership

Renter activity cardholders enjoy certain privileges associated with membership, but are not members of the Assiciation, do not have the right to vote in Association affairs or be counted in determining a quorum at any meeting of the Association, cannot run for or hold any elected position within the Community, and are not entitled to be listed on the membership register. Renters with leasing contracts of one year or more may be listed in the Resident Directory. Ballots, assessment notices, and any other items required by the Governing Documents to be given to Owners or Members will be given to the Owner of record, and are not required to be given to the lessee. 

#### 3.2.4. Revocation of Activity Card

A renter’s activity card will be revoked in the event that the renter is no longer a resident, upon termination of the lease agreement, or failure to pay applicable fees. The holder of a renter activity card is subject to sanctions for a violation of these Community Rules.

## 4. ADDRESS CHANGE

The Owner of the Lot is obligated to immediately notify the Association, in writing, within 15 days of any change of mailing address, whether such change is temporary or permanent. Failure to do so may delay delivery of account statements, Association notices, and other time-sensitive material sent out by the Association.

## 5. AMENITIES
