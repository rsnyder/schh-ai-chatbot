**Grocery Shopping on a Budget**  
As household costs increase, grocery shopping on a budget can be challenging. But there are ways to create a budget that works for you and tips on sticking to it. To get started on a food budget, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers an online grocery budget calculator. \[What You Spend - Spend Smart Eat Smart (iastate.edu)\] Simply enter your information and it will calculate a weekly budget based on the latest market prices.  
  
According to the National Council on Aging, here are some tips to help you follow your budget when shopping.  
  
      1. Make a list before you shop and only buy what is on the list.  
      2. Check your pantry before you leave to make sure you aren’t overbuying.  
      3. Try to prepare meals from scratch as often as possible, as processed and convenience items are more expensive and less healthy.  
      4. Try to purchase only in-season produce, as it is less expensive and tastes better.  
      5. Plan your meals ahead of time to create a predictable meal routine.  
      6. Take advantage of coupons and plan your meals around sales.   
      7. Find out if you are eligible for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) to help you stretch your grocery budget further.
