## About Sun City Hilton Head

Located in the heart of the South Carolina Lowcountry, Sun City Hilton Head is a premier active adult community home to more than 17,500 residents. The community is the brainchild of construction mogul Del Webb, who first pioneered the age-restricted active adult lifestyle in Arizona before bringing his vision to the East Coast with Sun City Hilton Head. Before development began for Sun City, the land belonged to the Union Camp Company, which used the property as an industrial pine tree farm for paper manufacturing. In June 1993, Del Webb Communities, Inc. purchased the 5,100 acres from the Union Camp Company and began construction in April 1994. Sun City Hilton Head opened its gates in June 1995, and the first 100 residents moved into their new homes that August. The developer, now PulteGroup, remains on property until home construction is complete. In 2018, approximately 52 acres of land were purchased for the north side of the community, adding another 183 homes. Since its establishment, the community has grown to be a transformative force and cornerstone of the Hilton Head and Bluffton region.
