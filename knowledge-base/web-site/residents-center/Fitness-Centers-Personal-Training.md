### TRX Functional Training

TRX functional training meets at Purrysburg Fitness Center and utilizes the TRX Studio for its sessions. Each session is led by a certified instructor and is limited to six participants. TRX functional training is a fast, effective, total body workout that uses the TRX resistance straps, your body weight and gravity to build strength, balance, coordination, flexibility and joint stability. This small group setting allows for people of all levels to train together. During the intro session, learn the “Big 3” exercises and complete a mini-circuit to see if TRX training is the right fit. All participants must complete the intro course prior to joining the regular small group training sessions. Call or visit Purrysburg Fitness Center to register for the intro course or get more information. Pre-registration is required for both the intro course and small group training sessions.  

Sessions are 45 minutes each. Fees for a small group training package and intro course can be found in the Fee Schedule on the [Governing Documents](https://suncityhiltonhead.org/Page/46134~1049547/Governing-Documents) page.
