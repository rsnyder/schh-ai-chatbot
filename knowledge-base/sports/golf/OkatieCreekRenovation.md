# Okatie Creek Renovation

Information extracted from Golf Town Hall meeting conducted on October 22, 2024

## Project Scope

### Greens

- Remove existing turf on greens and collars and establish original size.
- Remove 6-inches of 30-years old greens mix and add new mix.
- Sod collars with TifGrand Bermuda.
- Sprig greens with TifEagle Bermuda, more resistant to root rot disease we see in our Mini-Verde greens. 
- Irrigation replacement 2 years ago accommodates larger green sizes.

### Fairways

- Remove existing turf that has been sprayed out with herbicide.
- Add drainage lines with 12-foot spacing to include entrances and exits.
- Top-dress fairways with 2-inches of sand and spread into existing soil.
- Sprig fairways with Celebration Bermuda. 
- In 2023 we had 60 CPO days, we anticipate new drainage will cut this in half.

### Tee Boxes

- Remove existing turf and expand select tees box areas.
- Construct Orange tee boxes.
- Add 1-inch of removed greens mix.
- Laser level and sprig with Celebration Bermuda. 

### Practice Area

- Remove existing tee box turf and cart path.
- Expand tee box by 50% to accommodate 25-30 hitting stations and laser level tee.
- Shape three practice greens and two practice bunkers on west side of tee box creating an all-in-
one short game practice area.
- Renovate existing practice green by clubhouse. 
- Construct 12-foot-wide cart path and add plantation mix parking areas up under trees.
- Expand concrete pad for new range mats.
- Tee box sprigged with Celebration Bermuda, greens sprigged with TifEagle, same as the golf course turf.

## Tee Time Rules/Changes During Closure

### 2025 Tee Time Rules - March 31 - September 30

- Discussions began a few years ago when renovation work was first considered.
- GAC committee and Staff met over the last several months to formulate a plan.
- GAC recommendations were presented to the Board of Directors. 
- The Board approved the recommendations. Continue current Chelsea point and priority system.
- Tee time confirmations will be emailed 5 days in advance.
- Chartered Clubs (WGA, MGA, Couples Golf, Women’s 9, and Men’s 9) will alternate courses each week. 
- Non-Chartered Club Groups, and Neighborhood outings will need to go through Chelsea.
- Accompanied guest play is still allowed.
- Tee times may begin at sunrise.
- No outside tournaments, no shotgun events, no Troon Rewards rounds.
- Linked groups are limited to 16 players.
- Argent Lakes driving range may be designated for use by daily green fee users, pushing practice users to Hidden Cypress driving range.
- Tee time placement at HC will be 18-hole reservations from opening until 3:00pm.  After this, 9-hole reservations may be made by calling the golf shop.  9 or 18-hole reservations will be accepted after 3:00pm, also when PM rates begin.
- Tee time placement at AL will be 18-hole only until 9:00am, then 9-hole only the rest of day, this includes use of #1 and #10 tee starts after 11:00am each day.
- Players who were placed as an 18-hole reservation but play 9-holes will be charged for 18.
- The tee time rules allow enough availability to accommodate our current demand.
- For example:
  - Tuesday April 16, 2024
    - 298   18-hole total rounds played on all three courses.
    - 300   9-hole rounds played on all three.
  - Tuesday April 15, 2025 Sunset is 7:53pm
    - 300   18-hole capacity teeing off as early as 7:15am.
    - 304   9-hole capacity teeing off as late as 6:00pm.  
    *keep in mind, 9-hole reservations may fill in early in day.
  - Tuesday June 4, 2024
    - 260   18-hole rounds played 
    - 168   9-hole rounds played
  - Tuesday June 3, 2025 - Sunset is 8:27pm
    - 320   18-hole capacity
    - 304   9-hole capacity
- We want you to play here, however, if the tee time you get is not to your liking, you may cancel and play elsewhere, we will post information of local course deals and how to make a tee time there.
- Keep in mind, you own these courses, playing here benefits you as an owner.  Playing down the street helps the owner of that golf course.

## 2025 Golf Plan and Greens Fee Rates

### Proposed Golf Plan and Green Fees Rates for 2025

- Structure of golf plans and daily green fees remain the same as 2024.
- Golf operating budget reflects approximately 300k loss due to the OC closure.
- 5% rate increase to accommodate increase in normal operating expenses.
- South Carolina tax change for golf plans removes the 5% state admissions tax. Note that 5% state and 2.5% county admissions remains on daily green fees.
