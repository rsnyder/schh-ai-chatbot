> _**Bluffton, A Historical State of Mind**_ is presented by Michael Reynolds, a Bluffton native who grew up in Bluffton when it was a 1-square mile town with very little traffic and when everyone knew each other. Michael can trace his family history back 325 years in Beaufort County to a 1695 cattle brand stamp. The presentation will cover Bluffton's history starting with the Native Americans who lived here for centuries before the Europeans came. It includes a recount of the details of colonial times, the post-civil war era, and right up to modern-day Bluffton. You will be amazed by all that has happened in Bluffton!
