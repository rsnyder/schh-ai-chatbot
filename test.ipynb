      "      \"content\": \"Pickleball is a paddle sport that combines elements of tennis, badminton, and table tennis. It is played on a badminton-sized court with a slightly modified tennis net. Players use a paddle and a plastic ball with holes, known as a wiffle ball. The game can be played as singles or doubles, and it's popular among all age groups due to its simple rules and accessibility.\\n\\n**Key Features:**\\n- **Court Dimensions**: A pickleball court is 20 feet wide and 44 feet long for both singles and doubles play, with a non-volley zone called the \\\"kitchen\\\" extending 7 feet from the net on each side.\\n- **Scoring**: Games are typically played to 11 points, and a player or team must win by 2 points.\\n- **Serving**: The serve is underhand and must be made diagonally crosscourt, starting from the right-hand service square.\\n- **Double Bounce Rule**: After the serve, each side must let the ball bounce once before volleys are allowed.\\n\\nPickleball is appreciated for its social and inclusive nature, making it a popular choice for community centers, schools, and retirement communities. It's known for being easy to learn but challenging to master, offering both recreational and competitive play. The sport has been growing rapidly in popularity worldwide, with numerous clubs and tournaments, including national and international championships.\",\n",
