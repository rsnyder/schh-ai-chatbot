What modifications require an application? \\\\nA. All exterior changes being made to a home require an application. The following \\\\nmodifications have applications that can be completed online: driveways, exterior paint and \\\\nsiding, garage doors (including privacy screens), roofs and roof enhancements, storm doors, \\\\nglass doors and front doors, trees and windows. All other applications must be submitted in \\\\nperson. \\\\nQ. Where can I find a modification application? \\\\nA. Applications that can be submitted online can be found on the Modifcations page of  \\\\nwww.SunCityHiltonHead.org. Hard copy forms can be downloaded on the Forms page \\\\nlocated under the Community Library tile of Resident Central. Applications are also available \\\\nat Palmetto Commons. \\\\nQ. Where can I find guidelines for any changes and fees associated with an application?\\\\nA. The Design Guidelines for both Sun City and Riverbend and the Schedule of \\\\nFees and Community Rules can be found on the Governing Documents page of                             \\\\nwww.SunCityHiltonHead.org. Homeowners in a managed neighborhood should also check \\\\nwith Managed Neighborhoods for any further restrictions. \\\\nQ. I have questions about how to fill the application out. How can I reach a Modifications \\\\nCoordinator?\\\\nA. The Modifications team can be reached at (843)705-4000 or by email at  \\\\nmodifications@schhca.com.\\\\nQ. Can my contractor submit an application for me?\\\\nA. Applications will not be accepted from contractors without prior written authorization \\\\nfrom the homeowner. \\\\nQ. Can I drop off a hard copy application at Palmetto Commons, or do I need to make an \\\\nappointment?\\\\nA. We are happy to accept your hard copy application at Palmetto Commons. Please check \\\\nthe back of SunSations magazine for current hours. No appointment is required. If you choose \\\\nto drop off an application, please do not apply online. Submitting a hard copy and an online \\\\napplication will delay the approval process.\\\\nQ. My color printer is not working properly. How do I submit a color photo to go with my \\\\napplication?\\\\nA. Any store with photo printing, such as CVS, Walgreens, Staples, etc., will be able to print \\\\ncolor photos for you.\\\\nMODIFICATION APPLICATION', '']\", 'type': 'Document'}, {'id': '39c798f5d993c00a1ed3e6052e1c1c5735f4a4c3591cc105c88f46a8fb703b1a', 'metadata': {}, 'page_content': \"['Design Guidelines | Rev. 12.18.2024 \\\\n4\\\\n2.1.6 Leased and Unoccupied Property\\\\nWith respect to the Design Guidelines, homeowners are responsible for the actions of their lessees and shall sign \\\\napplications for modification requests for their property. Nonresident owners are still responsible for compliance \\\\nwith all guidelines. Absence from the area does not relieve the homeowner from the responsibility to promptly \\\\ncorrect any noncompliance with the Design Guidelines. \\\\n3. Reviewing Body and Residential Property Owner Requirements \\\\n3.1 Reviewing Body\\\\nArticle XI of the CC&Rs establishes procedures and policies to maintain the integrity of the architectural and \\\\ndesign character of Sun City Hilton Head, including review and appointment of related committees. Until one \\\\nhundred percent (100%) of the Properties have been developed and conveyed to homeowners, the Declarant has \\\\nexclusive authority to administer and enforce architectural controls and to review and act on all applications for \\\\noriginal construction within Sun City Hilton Head. This right can only be surrendered prior to that time by a \\\\nrecorded written instrument executed by the Declarant.                                                                   \\\\nThe CC&Rs directs the Board to establish a Modifications Committee to have exclusive jurisdiction over \\\\nmodifications, additions, or alterations to existing structures on lots and the adjacent open space. The Board has \\\\nthe right to veto an action taken by the Modifications Committee which the Board determines, in its sole \\\\ndiscretion, to be inconsistent with the Design Guidelines. For purposes of these Design Guidelines, the \\\\n“Reviewing Body” refers either to the Modifications Committee or the Community Standards Modification \\\\nDepartment as appropriate under the circumstances.\\\\n3.2 Homeowner Responsibilities\\\\nHomeowners shall comply with these Design Guidelines in addition to CC&Rs, Board Policies, Schedule of Fees \\\\nand Community Rules and any applicable Supplemental CC&Rs. Homeowners shall submit plans (described \\\\nbelow) and receive written approval from the Reviewing Body prior to performing any of the work outlined.  \\\\n3.2.1 Work Performed by Contractors\\\\nHomeowners are responsible for the timely completion of modification projects per the approved application. \\\\nFailure of contractors or other agents to complete work on time or performing work at variance with the approved \\\\nplans will result in Community Association action against the homeowner and possible exclusion of the contractor \\\\nfrom the property as outlined in Article XI: Architectural and Design Standards of the CC&Rs. The \\\\nModifications Committee does not deal with homeowner’s contractors nor intervene in disputes between \\\\nhomeowners and their contractors. Homeowners are cautioned to select their contractors carefully and monitor \\\\ntheir performance for both timeliness and adherence to the approved plans.\\\\n3.2.2 Timely Completion\\\\nOn-time completion of approved work is essential to minimize neighborhood disruption and lingering \\\\n“construction zone” appearance. If work is not completed prior to the expiration of the approval notice and \\\\nextension requests have not been granted, the homeowner is conducting modifications without a valid approval \\\\nand is subject to enforcement action.\\\\n3.2.2.1 Modification Extension Request\\\\nIf a modification is not completed in 120 days from the Notice to Proceed date, Homeowners must apply for a \\\\n30-day expiration date extension. \\\\n3.3 Modification Application Requirements\\\\n3.3.1 Application Forms\\\\nThe Community Standards Department will provide modification application forms for homeowner use, some \\\\napplications may be found online. In addition to the basic application form, additional forms may be required for \\\\nspecific projects such as house painting, swimming pools, and satellite antennas. Each form contains a list of \\\\nrequired attachments to be included with the application.

This \\\\ndelivery constitutes “personal delivery” as discussed in the CC&Rs in Notice to Applicant.\\\\n4.3 Modifications Committee Reconsideration\\\\nHomeowners may request reconsideration by resubmitting their applications with changes or additional \\\\ninformation as noted below:\\\\na) Resubmitted applications shall include changes to correct all previous committee objections. Revisions shall be \\\\nclearly identified on the application materials with the revision date indicated.\\\\nb) If applications are resubmitted without changes, they shall include additional information or clarification that \\\\nwas not included in the previous application that will substantiate that the proposed modification meets all \\\\nguidelines.\\\\nc) The Modifications Committee will decide on revised applications based on the revised documents submitted.\\\\n4.4 Appeals to the Board of Directors\\\\nHomeowners may appeal decisions of the Modifications Committee, in writing, to the Board in accordance with \\\\nprocedures established by the Board. Such appeals shall be submitted in writing to the Community Standards \\\\nModification Department for the Board\\'s consideration.\\\\n5. Non-Liability for the Approval of Plans \\\\n5.1 Non-Liability Disclaimer \\\\nArticle 11.7 of the CC&Rs states, “Review and approval of any application pursuant to this Article is made on the \\\\nbasis of aesthetic considerations only and neither the Declarant, the Association, the Board, nor the Modifications \\\\nCommittee shall bear any responsibility for ensuring the structural integrity or soundness of approved \\\\nconstruction or modifications, or for ensuring compliance with building codes and other governmental \\\\nrequirements. Neither the Declarant, the Association, the Board, nor the Modifications Committee, nor any \\\\nmember, director, officer, or authorized agent of any of the foregoing shall be held liable for any injury, damages, or \\\\nloss arising out of the manner or quality of approved construction on or modifications to any Lot. In all matters, \\\\nthe foregoing shall be defended and indemnified by the Association as provided in this Declaration or the \\\\nBylaws.”\\\\n5.1.1 No Guarantee of Suitability or Safety \\\\nHomeowners are cautioned that all modifications to property are at the homeowner’s risk. \\\\n5.1.2 Effect of Modifications on House Warranty \\\\nHomeowners are responsible for verifying the effect of any proposed modifications on any existing warranty. \\\\n6. Residential Design Guidelines \\\\n6.1 Introduction\\\\nThis section contains specific guidance and limitations for external changes to Sun City Hilton Head residences \\\\nand lots. All modifications to residences and lots require advance approval as set forth in Section 1.5 Required \\\\nApprovals . Proposed modifications will be reviewed for approval to ensure the requested changes are in harmony \\\\nwith the individual and neighboring properties. This article contains both general guidelines, such as size \\\\nlimitations and setback requirements, and specific guidelines. It also contains restrictions on certain house \\\\nmodifications, limits on quantities or size of certain exterior items and prohibits some types of modifications. \\\\nHomeowners should familiarize themselves with this article before submitting a modification request.\", \\'\\']', 'type': 'Document'}, {'id': '894dd03f4394d9ecb5f7948f8b86c1dcbe2d6cab18d12b8709e0e7a4eec3f51b', 'metadata': {}, 'page_content': \"['Design Guidelines | Rev. 12.18.2024\\\\n5\\\\nwww.SunCityHiltonHead.org . Forms will be revised as needed to improve the efficiency and accuracy of the \\\\nmodification process. Staff members will assist and advise homeowners who have questions about preparing \\\\nmodification applications. \\\\n3.3.1.2 Complete Package Required\\\\nHomeowners shall fill out application forms completely and attach any required documents such as elevations, \\\\nplans, plot plans, photos, material samples and product information/specifications.\\\\n3.3.1.3 Applications Shall Be Self Supporting\\\\nReview decisions will be based on the information included in the application package. Incomplete packages will \\\\nbe returned to the homeowner for resubmission. Homeowners with particularly complex projects may obtain \\\\nadvice from the Community Standards Modification Department staff prior to submission. Applications that \\\\nrequire revision or additional information will be returned to the homeowner with the Modifications Committee’s \\\\nreview comments. In some instances, the chairperson may direct a visit by committee members to obtain \\\\nadditional site information or clarify details prior to a committee vote on the proposed modification.\\\\n3.3.1.4 Plot Plans\\\\nScaled plot plans (identifying how the proposed modification will be imposed on the lot may be required for all \\\\napplications). Elevations (identifying how the proposed modification will look upon completion) may also be \\\\nrequired. Original homeowners should ensure that they retain their original developer plot plan copies. Previous \\\\nadditions shall be clearly identified on the plot plan and included with any applications for future modifications. \\\\nHomeowners may request copies of plot plans for their lot from the Community Standards Department when \\\\navailable. \\\\n3.3.1.5 Multiple Items on a Single Application\\\\nEach application shall contain only those items related to a single project. Homeowners shall submit separate \\\\napplications for unrelated modifications. \\\\n3.3.1.6 Incomplete Applications\\\\nIncomplete applications will be returned to the homeowner for revision. Processing time standards do not \\\\ncommence until a complete application is received.\\\\n3.3.1.7 Signature and Submission\\\\nApplications must be signed and submitted by the homeowner, in person or by mail, to the Community Standards \\\\nDepartment. Submissions not signed by the homeowner will not be accepted from a contractor.\\\\n3.3.1.8 Changes to Approved Applications\\\\nAny changes to an approved modification must be submitted to the Community Standards Modification \\\\nDepartment for approval prior to implementation. Unapproved changes may result in the costly rework of the \\\\nproject and fines.\\\\n3.4 Application Processing                                                                          \\\\n3.4.1 Fees\\\\nWhen required per the Schedule of Fees and Community Rules, fees are payable at the time of application \\\\nsubmission.
